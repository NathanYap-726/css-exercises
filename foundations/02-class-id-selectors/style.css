/* Be careful how that works. I had some difficulty using the rgb command cause it was sitting in bracket rgb(red, green, blue) Need to more selective I guess.
Try to find out what the hell is happening there. Same thing with font family function. Why do some need quotes and some not.

So after some reading it seems the syntax of the rgb function will always give all 3.
the font-family function basically gives several choices for the browser to choose. The quotes appear on some the fonts is because there is white space so 
DejaVu Sans needs it because there is whitespace instead of a hyphen. */
