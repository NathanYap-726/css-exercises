<!--I need to pay attention to what I have on ny style sheet because for example Number 4 is asked to have a font text size of 24.
and I already have a class that makes it font size 24. Instead of making id-element-two also have the same font size I can just assign
a class towards it. The solution explains it nicely. But I need to pay attention when I do have overlap code because I missed it.-->
